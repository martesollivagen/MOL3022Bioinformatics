This file contains the models created during training

Neural Network already exists and is saved as "neural_network_model.h5"

The models for Support Vector Machine and Random Forest cannot be saved in the 
github repo and has to be trained when running the project for the first time.
These will be as "svm_model.pkl" and "rf_model.pkl"
